# Exploring and Visualizing Personal Music Trends with Spotify

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive study into personal music listening behaviors using Spotify data. Our analysis delves into community detection, signed networks, and temporal dynamics to understand user-specific preferences and engagement with music. The goal is to provide insights that can improve user experience and music recommendation algorithms on Spotify.

## Key Features
- **Community Detection**: Implements several algorithms to detect clusters of musical interests within the Spotify dataset.
- **Signed Network Analysis**: Examines positive and negative interactions between users and music tracks to reveal deeper insights into user preferences.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Analyzes listening patterns over time to identify peak periods of music activity.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides detailed visual representations of user data to better understand music preferences and behaviors.

## Technologies Used
- **R Programming Language**: For all data processing and analysis.
- **SpotifyR**: To interface directly with the Spotify Web API for accessing user data.
- **igraph**: Utilized for network analysis, particularly in community detection.
- **ggplot2**: Used to create detailed and informative visualizations.
